/**
 * Example: Status and Reset
 * Description:
 *   This example is very similar to the "minimal" example.
 *   But here we provide a status indicator LED, to get feedback
 *   of the thing state.
 *   Further more we set up a push button. If push button is detected
 *   to be pressed at boot time, the thing will use the initial
 *   password for accepting connections in Access Point mode. This
 *   is usefull e.g. when custom password was lost.
 *   (See previous examples for more details!)
 * 
 * Hardware setup for this example:
 *   - An LED is attached to LED_BUILTIN pin with setup On=LOW.
 *     This is hopefully already attached by default.
 *   - A push button is attached to pin D2, the other leg of the
 *     button should be attached to GND.
